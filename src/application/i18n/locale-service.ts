 * The single source of truth for the app's active language.

 * localized create/update payloads, and — through the HTTP client's
 * `localeProvider` — the `Accept-Language` header on every request. Nothing
 * else may read the device language or keep its own copy, otherwise a language
 * switch can leave one of them stale (the bug this class exists to prevent).
 *
 * Precedence is strictly: stored user choice > device language > default. The
 * device language is a synchronous seed so the first render has *something* to
 * show; it must never reach the backend. {@link hydrate} is what guarantees that
 * — every request awaits it, so a saved preference can never lose to the device
