/**
 * Cross-cutting regular expressions shared by more than one layer.
 *
 * Feature-local patterns (ingredient parsing, route matching) stay next to the
 * code that owns them; only patterns that would otherwise be re-declared —
 * and drift — live here.
 *
 * INVARIANT: no pattern here may carry the `g` or `y` flag. These are shared,
 * module-level instances, and a sticky/global RegExp keeps `lastIndex` between
 * calls — so two unrelated call sites would silently corrupt each other's
 * matches. A pattern needing `g` must be constructed per use, not added here.
