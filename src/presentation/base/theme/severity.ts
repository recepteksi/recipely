/**
 * Severity is the semantic role of a feedback surface, independent of the app's
 * brand hue. Maps directly to the Recipely "Error States" design system:
 * - `danger`  — an action failed or content can't be shown (red)
 * - `warning` — a persistent condition the user should know about (amber)
 * - `success` — a confirmation (green); feedback surfaces aren't only for errors
 * - `neutral` — nothing is wrong, there's just nothing here yet (muted)
