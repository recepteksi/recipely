/**
 * Tracks whether the software keyboard is currently visible.
 *
 * WHY: `KeyboardAvoidingView`'s `behavior="padding"` already pads its content
 * up by exactly the keyboard's height once shown — that padding alone is
 * flush with the keyboard's top edge, no safe-area buffer needed on top of it
 * (the keyboard already occludes the home indicator area). A sticky bottom
 * bar that *also* adds a fixed `insets.bottom` for the keyboard-hidden state
 * ends up double-padded while the keyboard is up, showing a visible gap
 * above it. Callers should zero out that extra inset while this is `true`.
 *
 * Web has no software keyboard to track, so this always reports `false` there.
